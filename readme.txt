System Requirements
-------------------

How To Play
-----------

BASICS:

Click and select 2 adjacent caps or click-and-drag a cap onto an adjacent
cap to swap them. If the swap creates a group of 3 or more matching caps either
vertically or diagonally, the caps will be flipped and collapsed.

Collapsing groups of caps fills the progress meter on the right side of the
playfield. Filling the progress meter ends the round and begins the next one.

MYSTERY WORD BONUS:

* Each round starts with a blank Mystery Word Bonus.
* Collapsing caps with Letter Bonuses fills in the Mystery Word.
* Collecting all the letters reveals the Mystery Word and awards the bonus.
* The value of the bonus is based on how many letters the word contains.

BONUS ROUNDS:

* A race to match as many pairs of caps as possible before time runs out.
* Simply click on any two caps to see if they match (they need not be adjacent).
* If they match, they’ll be removed from the playfield.
* If they don’t match, they will simply flip back over.
* Each successive match is worth more points.
* After time runs out, your total matches and bonus points will be presented.

Troubleshooting
---------------

This software has been tested extensively to make sure it will operate
correctly for all users. If you experience system crashes, error messages or
other incorrect behavior, we suggest you first try one of the following:

1) Upgrade your computer's sound card drivers. This can be done by identifying
the type of sound card your computer is using and finding the manufacturer's web
site. Or, most drivers will be automatically updated if you follow step #2.

2) Upgrade DirectX. This is a Microsoft component and it includes special
drivers for video cards and sound cards for virtually every manufacturer. It is
therefore a very large download, but updating DirectX solves nearly all system
problems encountered with GameHouse games.
